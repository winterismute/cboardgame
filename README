cboardgame
===================

A version of the Othello boardgame made in C.
Uses SDL for a rough GUI. Has a minmaxing AI that uses a basic heuristic of Othello (positions close to borders,
or even corners, of the board are considered more advantageous).

WARNING: this was one of my first C projects!
